## [Remove unused variables and code](../../../../doc/coding/pl_sql/coding_style.md#RemoveUnused)

You should go through your programs and remove any part of your code that is no longer used. 

There's never a better time to review all the steps you took, and to understand the reasons you took them, than immediately upon completion of your program. "Dead zones" in your code become sources of deep insecurity for maintenance programmers.

You should also leverage tools that will perform this analysis for you.
