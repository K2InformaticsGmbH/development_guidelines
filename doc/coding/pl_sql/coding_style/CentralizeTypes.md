## [Centralize `TYPE` definitions in package specifications](../../../../doc/coding/pl_sql/coding_style.md#CentralizeTypes.md)

As you use more and more of the PL/SQL language features, you will define many `TYPEs` of things, including:

- `SUBTYPEs` that define application-specific datatypes
-Â·Collection `TYPEs`, such as lists of numbers, dates, or records
- Referenced cursor `TYPEs`, from which cursor variables are declared

Some of these `TYPEs` can be used unchanged throughout your application; other types are specific to some part of an application but are standard within that.

In either case, create a package to hold these standard `TYPEs`, so that they can be used in multiple programs.

#### Example:

```PLSQL
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE colltype
IS
    TYPE boolean_ntab  IS TABLE OF BOOLEAN;
    TYPE boolean_ibtab IS TABLE OF BOOLEAN INDEX BY BINARY_INTEGER;
    TYPE date_ntab     IS TABLE OF DATE;
    TYPE date_ibtab    IS TABLE OF DATE    INDEX BY BINARY_INTEGER;
...
END colltype;
```
